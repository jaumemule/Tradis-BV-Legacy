This will store a Sqlite database with the results of the study in question. This is meant to work separately per each server

To run a NEW study follow this steps:

- Create a new branch study/{study_name}
- Edit study.py `study_name` (important if is new)
- Edit `database` if this is a different server than the number 1, otherwise would overlap later while uploading results
- Edit study._optimize_params function, passing the desired arguments to the simulator
- Edit param_space.py and add the fields that need to be studied

Once completed, upload the results to S3:

- SSH to the machine and go to director/src/simulations
- Execute `{machine_number}_study_server_results.sh`

Have fun!
